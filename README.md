**Introduction**

In this project, I created the client-side code for a page that displays data about Pokemon. The page uses AJAX so that it can dynamically load new data into an already loaded page.

The project involves the use of JavaScript to modify the contents of a webpage, and fetch() to load data from an external API hosted on our trex-sandwich.com server.

The project required me to write all of my code using the technologies taught in the lectures/labs, and I could not use any other larger external libraries, frameworks, or pre-written CSS, JS, or HTML. Some sections of the project gave quite a lot of freedom to research my own design and implementation.

**Project structure**

The project directory is quite straightforward and consists of:
index.html, script.js and style.css

**General description**

I created a single page that would allow a user to view data about all Pokemon and Pokemon types. As the user selects options on the page, the data is loaded dynamically from the server (trex-sandwich.com) with fetch requests, and displayed in the page through client-side JavaScript code.

The page is responsive and changes from a maximum of three columns wide for wide screens to a single-column layout for smaller screens. The page is structured with multiple divs that are positioned using CSS grid.
